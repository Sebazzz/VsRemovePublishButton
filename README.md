# VsRemovePublishButton VisualStudio Extension
This very simple extension hides the "Publish" button in the Visual Studio status bar. This is useful if you're using a different version control system or simply don't want to see this button.

The Publish button in Visual Studio polutes the status bar if you don't use it, and can also cause accidental creation of a Git repository on the project location.
